There are a lot of files that do not want to be touched. All of the gradle stuff should be left alone.
Files that are the game itself:
  /core/src/com.taxe   ---  Main game files themselves
  /core/src/resources  ---  Images and audio and stuff
  /desktop/src/com.taxe.desktop/DesktopLauncher  --- This is the entry point class, it sends us over to Main in the core source
